## Database Verification

### Connect to MySQL
```sql
mysql -u root -p
-- Enter password: Abi@6369487158

USE ubermanager;
```

### Check Tables
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
-- Should show: users, drivers, rides, payments, ratings
```

### Verify Data
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;    -- Should be >= 5
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drivers;  -- Should be >= 5
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rides;    -- Should be >= 7
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments; -- Should be >= 4
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ratings;  -- Should be >= 4
```

### Check Relationships
```sql
-- Rides with user and driver names
SELECT 
    r.ride_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    d.name AS driver_name,
    r.status
FROM rides r
JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN drivers d ON r.driver_id = d.driver_id;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Port 8080 Already in Use
**Solution:**
1. Find process using port: `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`
2. Kill process OR
3. Change port in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   server.port=8081
   ```

### Issue 2: Cannot Connect to MySQL
**Solution:**
1. Check MySQL is running: Windows Services → MySQL
2. Verify credentials in `application.properties`
3. Test connection: `mysql -u root -p`

### Issue 3: Build Fails
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
mvn clean install -U

# If still fails, check Java version
java -version  # Should be 17+
```

### Issue 4: Database Not Created
**Solution:**
Create manually:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE ubermanager;
```

### Issue 5: No Sample Data
**Solution:**
Run `data.sql` manually:
```sql
USE ubermanager;
SOURCE d:/JAVA DBMS Project/src/main/resources/data.sql;
```
